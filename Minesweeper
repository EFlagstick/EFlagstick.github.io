Instructions to play my game!

Follow this link to access my colab notebook for my project: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14owg5ViYcwe-R9yhAvPLXw3GxVKOpfIe
Go to "Runtime" then click "Run all" to get the code cells functioning
The function should have already ran, but if it hasn't click run on the "minesweeper" function at the tope
Follow the instructions from there and have fun with my game!
