### Project Focus

The focus of my project is to build a functioning minesweeper game

---

### Why This Project 

I really enjoy playing minesweeper, I have been playing it as a fun little pasttime in and outside of school. I think it would be cool if I said I was able to actually code a game that I myself enjoy playing.

---

### What I Want to Learn

I want to learn how to use GUI and actively respond to user intput from that GUI. I think this expands my knowledge of python if I can make code that updates depending on what a user does at any certain point.



### My Approach 

I think that I will start with GUI, once I learn how to actually set up the board, I will then learn how to read user input. After I learn how to read user input I can put reactions, and therefore begin the game. I will start with whether or not a mine is on a square and the dying function, because that is the basis of the game, if I have a good amount of time I will then add flags and might be able to get to the niche functions, such as the game automatically getting rid of squares that don't have any number that indicate if there are mines nearby.

### What's Next

I plan to learn user GUI and user input first.
