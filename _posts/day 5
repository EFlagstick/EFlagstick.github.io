### What I Set Out to Do
Today I set out ot finish the game, this includes bug fixes and adding a way for a player to win.

### What I Actually Did

I met my goal of what I wanted to do today, I think I fixed all my bugs to the best extent, and added a functioning way to win.

### What I Learned or Noticed

Something I noticed today was that finishing a big project is very satisfying. During this project, I got very annoyed multiple times, becuase I didn't know what to do, or I didn't understand why my code wasn't working. Now that I am done with this project, and actually ran the game and played it a litte, I felt very happy with myself, because I actually created a functioning game.

### What's Next

In the future, I might want to create a gui if I feel like that would be fun to do.
