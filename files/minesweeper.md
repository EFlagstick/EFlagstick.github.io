Instructions to play my game!

Follow this link to access my colab notebook for my project: [Minesweeper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14owg5ViYcwe-R9yhAvPLXw3GxVKOpfIe)


Go to the runtime tab and press “run all”


There may be a couple of issues when you press run all, so you may have to go and run each code cell indevidually, but it should work otherwise.


If it isn't already running, run the first code cell which is minesweeper(), and follow the instructions from there.


Enjoy the game!
